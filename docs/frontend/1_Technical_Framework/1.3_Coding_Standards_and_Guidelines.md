# 1.3 Coding Standards and Guidelines (Frontend v2)

This document outlines coding standards for the v2 frontend of the Salary Information Management System, built with React, TypeScript, and Vite.

## 1. General Principles

*   **Readability & Clarity:** Code should be self-explanatory where possible. Use meaningful names for variables, functions, and components.
*   **Consistency:** Adhere to the conventions outlined in this document and in the chosen linters/formatters.
*   **Component-Based Design:** Embrace React's component model. Create small, reusable, and well-defined components.
*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid duplicating code. Extract reusable logic into utility functions, custom hooks, or shared components.
*   **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Prefer simpler solutions over complex ones if they achieve the same result effectively.
*   **Modularity & Reusability:** Design components and functions to be modular and reusable across different parts of the application.

## 2. TypeScript Usage

*   **Strong Typing:** Utilize TypeScript's type system extensively. Define explicit types for props, state, function arguments/return values, and API payloads.
*   **Interfaces and Types:** Use `interface` for defining object shapes (especially for public APIs like component props) and `type` for unions, intersections, or more complex type definitions.
*   **Avoid `any`:** Minimize the use of `any`. If `any` is necessary, provide a comment explaining why.
*   **Strict Mode:** Enable TypeScript's `strict` mode in `tsconfig.json` for better type safety.

## 3. React Best Practices

*   **Functional Components & Hooks:** Prefer functional components with Hooks over class components for new development.
*   **Component Naming:** Use PascalCase for component names (e.g., `UserProfileCard.tsx`).
*   **Props:**
    *   Define prop types using TypeScript interfaces.
    *   Use destructuring for props within components.
    *   Provide default props where appropriate.
*   **State Management:**
    *   Use `useState` for local component state.
    *   For global or shared state, use the chosen state management library (Zustand/Redux Toolkit) following its best practices.
*   **Keys in Lists:** Always provide stable and unique `key` props when rendering lists of elements.
*   **Memoization:** Use `React.memo`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` judiciously to optimize performance, only when profiling indicates a bottleneck.
*   **File Structure:** Organize components, pages, hooks, etc., according to the agreed-upon project structure (see `1.1_Frontend_Architecture.md`).
*   **Error Boundaries:** Consider using React Error Boundaries to catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed.

## 4. Code Formatting & Linting

*   **Formatter:** Use Prettier for consistent code formatting. Configure it via `.prettierrc.js` (or similar).
*   **Linter:** Use ESLint with relevant plugins (e.g., for React, TypeScript, accessibility) to enforce code quality rules and catch potential errors. Configure via `.eslintrc.js` (or similar).
*   **IDE Integration:** Configure your IDE to use these tools for auto-formatting on save and to display linting errors.
*   **Pre-commit Hooks:** Consider using tools like Husky and lint-staged to run linters and formatters automatically before commits.

## 5. Naming Conventions (Examples)

*   **Components:** `PascalCase` (e.g., `SalaryTable.tsx`)
*   **Hooks:** `useCamelCase` (e.g., `useAuth.ts`, `useEmployeeData`)
*   **Variables/Functions:** `camelCase` (e.g., `currentUser`, `fetchPayrollData`)
*   **Constants:** `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` (e.g., `DEFAULT_PAGE_SIZE`)
*   **CSS Modules/Classes:** `camelCase` or `kebab-case` (be consistent within the project, e.g., `styles.tableContainer` or `table-container`).

## 6. Styling (Ant Design & Custom CSS)

*   **Ant Design:** Leverage Ant Design components and their props for styling as much as possible.
*   **Theme Customization:** For global style changes (colors, fonts, etc.), modify Ant Design theme variables in `styles/theme.less`.
*   **CSS Modules:** For component-specific styles that need to be scoped, prefer CSS Modules (e.g., `MyComponent.module.css`).
*   **Avoid Global CSS Overrides:** Minimize direct overrides of Ant Design classes in global stylesheets unless absolutely necessary and well-justified.

## 7. API Interaction

*   All API calls should go through the centralized API service layer (`src/api/`).
*   Use `async/await` for asynchronous operations.
*   Implement proper error handling for API requests (e.g., displaying user-friendly messages, logging errors).

## 8. Accessibility (a11y)

*   Strive to create accessible interfaces. Use semantic HTML where appropriate.
*   Ensure Ant Design components are used with accessibility in mind (e.g., providing `alt` text for images, labels for form inputs).
*   Consider using ESLint accessibility plugins.

## 9. Testing

*   **Unit Tests:** Use a testing framework like Jest with React Testing Library to write unit tests for components and utility functions.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test interactions between components or a component with its services/store.
*   **End-to-End Tests (Optional but Recommended):** Consider tools like Cypress or Playwright for testing user flows.
*   **Test Coverage:** Aim for meaningful test coverage, focusing on critical paths and complex logic.

## 10. Code Reviews

*   Follow the project's code review process. All significant changes should be reviewed.
*   Reviews should focus on correctness, adherence to standards, performance, and security.

## 11. Commenting

*   **Clarity over Clutter:** Aim for self-documenting code. However, do not hesitate to add comments to explain:
    *   Complex logic that isn't immediately obvious.
    *   Workarounds for specific issues.
    *   Important decisions or assumptions made in the code.
    *   The purpose of non-trivial public functions or component props if not clear from their names.
*   **TODOs & FIXMEs:** Use `// TODO:` for planned enhancements or `// FIXME:` for known issues that need addressing, optionally followed by a brief explanation or issue tracker ID.
*   **Avoid Obvious Comments:** Do not comment on code that is straightforward and easy to understand from the code itself.

## 12. Performance Optimization
*   **Code Splitting:** Utilize dynamic `import()` for route-based or component-based code splitting to reduce initial bundle size.
*   **Lazy Loading:** Lazy load components and images that are not immediately visible (e.g., below the fold content).
*   **Image Optimization:** Compress images and use appropriate formats (e.g., WebP). Serve responsive images using `<picture>` element or `srcset` attribute.
*   **Reduce Re-renders:** Profile and optimize components to minimize unnecessary re-renders (leveraging `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback` effectively).
*   **Bundle Analysis:** Regularly analyze the production bundle (e.g., using `vite-plugin-analyzer` or `source-map-explorer`) to identify large dependencies or opportunities for optimization.

## 13. Security Considerations
*   **XSS Prevention:** Always sanitize user-generated content before rendering it. When using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, ensure the HTML is from a trusted source or properly sanitized.
*   **CSRF Protection:** While modern browser mechanisms and SameSite cookies offer some protection, be aware of CSRF if managing tokens or session manually.
*   **Dependency Vulnerabilities:** Regularly audit dependencies for known vulnerabilities (e.g., using `npm audit` or `yarn audit`) and update them.
*   **HTTPS:** Ensure the application is always served over HTTPS in production.
*   **API Security:** Rely on backend for critical data validation and authorization; frontend security is complementary.

*This document provides general guidelines. Specific project decisions or conventions agreed upon by the team, and detailed in `docs/v2/前端 2.0 设计框架.md` or `docs/v2/前端界面2.0 开发文档（优化版）.md`, will take precedence.*
