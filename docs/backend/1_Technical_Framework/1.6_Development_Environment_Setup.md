# 1.6 Development Environment Setup (Backend v2)

This document provides instructions and guidelines for setting up a consistent development environment for the backend of the Salary Information Management System (v2).

## 1. Prerequisites

*   **Operating System:** macOS, Linux, or Windows (with WSL2 recommended for Windows users).
*   **Git:** For version control. Ensure Git is installed and configured.
*   **Python:** (Specify V2 project's Python version, e.g., Python 3.9 or 3.10). It is highly recommended to use a Python version manager like `pyenv` to manage Python versions.
*   **Docker and Docker Compose:** For running PostgreSQL and potentially other services (e.g., Redis if used for caching) in a containerized environment. Required for a consistent database setup.
*   **IDE/Text Editor:** A suitable IDE or text editor with Python support (e.g., VS Code with Python extension, PyCharm).

## 2. Getting the Code

1.  Clone the repository from the designated Git provider:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd salary_system # Or the relevant project directory
    ```

## 3. Python Environment Setup

It is strongly recommended to use a virtual environment for Python dependencies.

1.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    Navigate to the backend project directory (e.g., `webapp/v2/` or a top-level backend directory if `requirements.txt` is there).
    ```bash
    python -m venv .venv  # Or use other tools like virtualenvwrapper, poetry, pdm
    ```
2.  **Activate the Virtual Environment:**
    *   macOS/Linux:
        ```bash
        source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
    *   Windows (Command Prompt):
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        ```
    *   Windows (PowerShell):
        ```bash
        .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
        ```
3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Install all required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file (ensure this file is specific to the backend V2).
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 4. Database Setup (Using Docker)

1.  Ensure Docker Desktop is running.
2.  A `docker-compose.yml` file should be present in the project (likely in the root or `docker/backend/` directory) defining the PostgreSQL service for V2.
3.  Start the PostgreSQL container:
    ```bash
    # From the directory containing the relevant docker-compose.yml
    docker-compose up -d db_v2 # Or the V2 database service name
    ```
    *This assumes a service named `db_v2` is defined in your Docker Compose file for the V2 database.*
4.  **Database Migrations:**
    Once the database container is running, apply Alembic migrations to set up the schema:
    ```bash
    # Ensure your .env file is configured with correct DB connection string for V2
    # Navigate to the directory containing alembic.ini for V2
    alembic upgrade head
    ```

## 5. Environment Variables (`.env` file)

1.  The backend application likely requires environment variables for configuration (e.g., database connection string, secret keys, API settings).
2.  There should be an `.env.template` or similar file in the backend directory (e.g., `webapp/v2/.env.template`).
3.  Copy this template to a `.env` file:
    ```bash
    cp .env.template .env
    ```
4.  Edit the `.env` file and fill in the necessary values, especially:
    *   `DATABASE_URL_V2` (or similar for V2 database connection)
    *   `SECRET_KEY`
    *   Any other required settings.
    *Ensure the database connection string in `.env` points to the Dockerized PostgreSQL instance for V2.*

## 6. Running the Backend Application (Development Server)

1.  Ensure the virtual environment is activated and the database is running.
2.  Navigate to the backend application directory (e.g., `webapp/v2/`).
3.  Run the FastAPI application using Uvicorn:
    ```bash
    # Example command, adjust module path (e.g., app.main:app) as needed
    uvicorn main:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 
    ```
    *(The exact command `main:app` depends on your application structure within `webapp/v2/`)*
4.  The API should now be accessible, typically at `http://localhost:8000/v2/docs` for the OpenAPI documentation.

## 7. Linters and Formatters

*   It is recommended to configure your IDE to use linters (e.g., Flake8) and formatters (e.g., Black) as defined in the coding standards to maintain code quality.
*   Pre-commit hooks can also be set up to run these tools automatically before committing code.

*This document provides general setup instructions. Refer to `docs/v2/项目开发核心信息.md` (which notes "开发环境" as "待补充") and any specific READMEs within the backend V2 codebase (`webapp/v2/`) for more precise V2 details.*
