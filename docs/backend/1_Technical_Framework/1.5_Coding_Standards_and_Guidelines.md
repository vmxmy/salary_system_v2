# 1.5 Coding Standards and Guidelines (Backend v2)

This document outlines the coding standards and guidelines to be followed for the backend development of the Salary Information Management System (v2). Adherence to these standards is crucial for maintaining code quality, readability, and maintainability.

## 1. General Principles

*   **Readability:** Write code that is easy to read and understand. Prioritize clarity over conciseness if conciseness obscures meaning.
*   **Simplicity (KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid):** Avoid unnecessary complexity. Prefer simpler solutions where possible.
*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** Avoid code duplication. Use functions, classes, and modules to encapsulate reusable logic.
*   **Consistency:** Follow consistent naming conventions, formatting, and architectural patterns throughout the codebase.

## 2. Python Language Standards

*   **PEP 8:** Adhere to [PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/).
    *   Use a linter (e.g., Flake8, Pylint) and a formatter (e.g., Black, autopep8) to enforce PEP 8 compliance automatically. MyPy should be used for static type checking.
*   **Type Hinting (PEP 484):** Use type hints for all function signatures and important variables to improve code clarity and enable static analysis.
*   **Docstrings (PEP 257):** Write clear and concise docstrings for all modules, classes, functions, and methods. Follow a standard format (e.g., Google style, NumPy style).
*   **Imports:**
    *   Organize imports according to PEP 8 (standard library, third-party, local application/library specific).
    *   Use tools like `isort` to automatically sort imports.

## 3. Code Organization (Layered Architecture)

*   **Presentation Layer (Routers/Endpoints):** Handles HTTP requests, calls business logic, returns HTTP responses. FastAPI path operation functions.
*   **Business Logic Layer (Services/Use Cases/Managers):** Encapsulates core business rules and processes, does not directly depend on specific framework HTTP details or ORM.
*   **Data Access Layer (CRUD/Repositories):** Responsible for interacting with the database, encapsulating SQLAlchemy query operations.
*   **Model Layer (Models):** SQLAlchemy data model definitions.
*   **Pydantic Model Layer (Schemas/DTOs):** API request/response data structure definitions and validation.
*   **Utilities/Shared Libraries (Utils/Libs):** Common utility functions or shared logic.
*   Adhere to the project's agreed-upon directory structure.
*   Avoid circular dependencies.

## 4. FastAPI Specific Guidelines

*   **Dependency Injection:** Utilize FastAPI's dependency injection system for managing dependencies (e.g., database sessions, service instances).
*   **Pydantic Models:** Use Pydantic models extensively for request/response validation and serialization. Define clear and precise schemas.
*   **Routers:** Organize API endpoints into logical groups using `APIRouter`.
*   **Asynchronous Code (`async`/`await`):** Use `async` and `await` for I/O-bound operations to leverage FastAPI's asynchronous capabilities, especially for database calls and external API requests.

## 5. SQLAlchemy Specific Guidelines

*   **Explicit Naming:** Use clear and explicit names for models, columns, and relationships.
*   **Session Management:** Manage SQLAlchemy sessions carefully, typically using FastAPI's dependency injection to provide a session per request.
*   **Query Optimization:** Be mindful of query performance. Use appropriate loading strategies (e.g., `selectinload`, `joinedload`) to avoid N+1 problems.

## 6. Naming Conventions

*   **Modules:** Lowercase with underscores (e.g., `user_service.py`).
*   **Packages:** Lowercase, preferably short (e.g., `routers`, `models`).
*   **Classes:** CapWords (e.g., `UserService`, `EmployeeModel`).
*   **Functions and Methods:** Lowercase with underscores (e.g., `get_user_by_id`, `create_employee`).
*   **Variables:** Lowercase with underscores (e.g., `current_user`, `total_salary`).
*   **Constants:** All uppercase with underscores (e.g., `MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`).

## 7. Error Handling and Logging

*   **Custom Exceptions:** Define custom exception classes for specific error conditions in the business logic. These should be raised in the business logic layer and caught in the presentation layer to be converted into appropriate HTTP error responses.
*   **Structured Logging:** Use a structured logging approach (e.g., using the `logging` module, configuring JSON format output) to make logs easier to parse and analyze. Include contextual information in log messages (e.g., request ID, user ID).
*   **Log Levels:** Use appropriate log levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL).

## 8. Testing

*   Use PyTest as the primary testing framework.
*   **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for individual functions and methods, especially for business logic in services and data access layer core functions.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between different components (e.g., service layer and data access layer).
*   **API/Endpoint Tests:** Test API endpoints to ensure they behave as expected (using tools like `pytest` with `HTTPX` or FastAPI's `TestClient`).
*   Tests should be isolated from the actual database where possible (using a test database or mocks).
*   **Test Coverage:** Aim for a reasonable level of test coverage.

## 9. Version Control (Git)

*   Follow the team's Git branching model (e.g., GitFlow, GitHub Flow).
*   Adhere to the team's commit message conventions (e.g., Conventional Commits).

## 10. Performance Optimization Guidelines

*   Optimize database queries (e.g., avoid N+1 problems, use indexes appropriately, analyze query plans).
*   Cache frequently accessed and rarely changed data (e.g., using Redis).
*   Use asynchronous I/O for high-concurrency requests.
*   Profile and identify performance bottlenecks when necessary.

## 11. Security

*   **Input Validation:** Always validate all incoming data (FastAPI with Pydantic helps greatly here).
*   **Parameterized Queries:** Use SQLAlchemy ORM or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
*   **Secrets Management:** Do not hardcode secrets (API keys, database passwords). Use environment variables or a secrets management system (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, Doppler).
*   **Principle of Least Privilege:** Ensure components and users only have the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.
*   Regularly audit dependencies for vulnerabilities and apply security patches.

## 12. Code Reviews

*   All code should be reviewed by at least one other team member before being merged.
*   Focus reviews on correctness, clarity, performance, security, and adherence to standards.

*This document provides general guidelines. Specific project decisions or conventions agreed upon by the team will supersede these general recommendations.*
