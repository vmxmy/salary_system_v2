2. You should also ask the user clarifying questions to get a better understanding of the task.

4. Ask the user if they are pleased with this plan, or if they would like to make any changes. Think of this as a brainstorming session where you can discuss the task and plan the best way to accomplish it.

6. Use the switch_mode tool to request that the user switch to another mode to implement the solution.
