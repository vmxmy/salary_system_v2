# Project Documentation Collaboration and Maintenance Guidelines

As an AI programming assistant for the "高新区工资信息管理系统 (salary_system)" project (V2), adhere to the following guidelines for utilizing and maintaining the project's documentation library located under the `docs/` directory.

## 1. Proactive Document Consultation for Context

Before starting new development tasks, modifying code, or seeking to understand module functionalities and design principles, **FIRST** proactively consult the relevant documents within the `docs/` directory. This includes subdirectories such as `docs/common/`, `docs/backend/`, and `docs/frontend/`.

Key documents for initial understanding and context include:

*   **Overall Structure**: [0_Overall_Documentation_Structure.md](mdc:docs/0_Overall_Documentation_Structure.md)
*   **Project Vision & Goals**: [0_Project_Vision_and_Goals.md](mdc:docs/common/0_Project_Vision_and_Goals.md)
*   **Documentation Standards**: [1_Documentation_Guide.md](mdc:docs/common/1_Documentation_Guide.md) (Adhere to this guide for all documentation work)
*   **Key Decisions**: [2_Decision_Log.md](mdc:docs/common/2_Decision_Log.md)
*   **Backend Overview**: [0_Overview_and_Roadmap.md](mdc:docs/backend/0_Overview_and_Roadmap.md)
*   **Frontend Overview**: [0_Overview_and_Roadmap.md](mdc:docs/frontend/0_Overview_and_Roadmap.md)
*   **Technical Frameworks**:
    *   Explore files within `docs/backend/1_Technical_Framework/` (e.g., [1.1_Backend_Architecture.md](mdc:docs/backend/1_Technical_Framework/1.1_Backend_Architecture.md), [1.2_Database_Design.md](mdc:docs/backend/1_Technical_Framework/1.2_Database_Design.md), [1.5_Coding_Standards_and_Guidelines.md](mdc:docs/backend/1_Technical_Framework/1.5_Coding_Standards_and_Guidelines.md))
    *   Explore files within `docs/frontend/1_Technical_Framework/` (e.g., [1.1_Frontend_Architecture.md](mdc:docs/frontend/1_Technical_Framework/1.1_Frontend_Architecture.md), [1.2_Technology_Stack_and_Libraries.md](mdc:docs/frontend/1_Technical_Framework/1.2_Technology_Stack_and_Libraries.md), [1.3_Coding_Standards_and_Guidelines.md](mdc:docs/frontend/1_Technical_Framework/1.3_Coding_Standards_and_Guidelines.md))
*   **Current Development Plans**:
    *   Backend: [2.1_Current_Development_Plan.md](mdc:docs/backend/2_Development_Tasks_and_Phases/2.1_Current_Development_Plan.md)
    *   Frontend: [2.1_Current_Development_Plan.md](mdc:docs/frontend/2_Development_Tasks_and_Phases/2.1_Current_Development_Plan.md)

If you believe existing documentation might answer a question or provide context for a task, prioritize reading the relevant documents over direct inquiry or assumptions.

## 2. Development and Decisions Based on Documentation

Ensure your code implementations, technical suggestions, and modifications align with the standards and design principles documented. If discrepancies are found or documentation appears outdated, please highlight this.

## 3. Timely Documentation Updates

After completing significant development tasks, introducing new technologies, making major architectural changes, or finishing key modules/features, **proactively prompt for updates or creation of relevant project documents**. Examples:

*   New API endpoint: Suggest updating API design docs.
*   Database schema change: Suggest updating database design docs.
*   New library/framework: Suggest updating technology stack docs.
*   Milestone completion: Suggest updating development plans/roadmaps.
*   Key technical decision: Suggest adding to the [2_Decision_Log.md](mdc:docs/common/2_Decision_Log.md).

When proposing code changes, also indicate any necessary corresponding documentation updates.

## 4. Adherence to Documentation Standards

When assisting with the creation or modification of Markdown documents, strictly follow the formatting, naming conventions, and content requirements outlined in the [1_Documentation_Guide.md](mdc:docs/common/1_Documentation_Guide.md).

**Objective**: To maintain the accuracy and timeliness of project documentation, making it a reliable resource for the team and minimizing miscommunication.
